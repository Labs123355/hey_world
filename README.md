### BFA Enrollment and Curriculum with Data Analysis

**Description:**
Conducted an analysis of enrollment trends and curriculum structure for the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) program at the University of Diploma Printing in Romanigstan. The project aimed to revitalize the program by aligning it with student interests and contemporary academic trends.

**Technologies:**
- Python (data analytics)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)
- Matplotlib (visualization)

**Key Features:**
- Preprocessed and cleaned five years of enrollment and course data.
- Identified discrepancies between the course catalog and actual enrollments, uncovering 139 unmatched courses.
- Utilized K-means clustering to group elective courses into coherent concentration areas.
- Recommended reducing total credit hours and streamlining elective offerings.

**Outcomes:**
The analysis provided actionable insights leading to the recommendation of a curriculum redesign, including a reduction in total credit hours from 39 to 33 and the grouping of electives into three distinct concentration areas.
